# Gyan Shiksha V3

## Scope
Gujarati Medium, Std. 6–12 only.
Special focus: Std. 10 and Std. 12 Board Exam.

## Technology
- HTML5
- Custom CSS (responsive UI/UX)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- SVG
- Python development scripts (`tools/`) for validation/build tasks
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Important
GitHub Pages does not execute PHP or Python on the server.
PHP/Python can be used for local/build automation or later on a backend host, but the live GitHub Pages website remains static.

## AdSense
The current launch build contains **no AdSense script, publisher ID or visible ad placeholders**.
Real ad code should be added only after AdSense approval/site setup and a final policy/privacy review. Keep Quiz iframe/Focus Mode ad-free unless the production configuration is separately reviewed.

## V3.1 Improvements
- Removed placeholder Gyan Shiksha email until domain setup
- Added client-side section search
- Improved mobile menu accessibility and body scroll handling
- Moved first AdSense placeholder below useful Quick Access content
- Added mobile/performance CSS refinements
- Added robots meta to indexable pages

## Current Home Page
The grade row and subject row have been intentionally removed.
Homepage now uses:
1. Hero + site search
2. Quick Access
3. Board Exam Focus / Practice Tools / Study Guidance
4. Footer

Only live/useful sections are promoted. Study Material and Updates remain `noindex` until real content is ready.

- Integrated existing Google Apps Script Quiz Saathi web app into `quiz.html`
- Added full-screen fallback link
- Updated CSP `frame-src` for Google Apps Script

- Reserved AdSense space after the quiz instead of near answer controls
- Quiz page is now indexable because it provides functional learning content

Quiz Web App:
`https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxM88Z2cZ1gVuXFU22R1ebiKmZywSqxPyr_VY669V_scB0eEdahGdSsRJn4AVzqQY4LXQ/exec`

### Manual repository cleanup still recommended
The GitHub repository description still references old Psychology/TAT content and the repository is still a fork. These are repository-level settings, not website-code defects.

## V3.10 Professional UX Polish
- Refined navigation hierarchy and made Quiz the primary action
- Replaced generic stock thumbnails on Home/Blog with branded visual blocks
- Kept the approved Home hero image while reducing unnecessary third-party image requests
- Improved Blog card consistency, visual identity and reading hierarchy
- Made Quiz Focus Mode the clearest primary start action while preserving the inline quiz
- Improved Games start state, mobile nav overlay and hover/focus behavior
- Kept the patch focused on live UX without changing policy/content architecture
